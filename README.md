The Playground of Bezier Curve

![Effect](./effect.gif)

## How to play with it?
```bash
    > git clone https://github.com/ZixiaoWang/BezierCurvePlayground.git
    > open index.html
```

## Why am I writting this?
For fun of course. The original requirement came from one of the projects which I was involved, the requirement was about to draw a 4th-order Bezier Curve, and the curve will be used as moving trace for something. So I was think maybe I was able to make a function to draw whatever-order Bezier Curve.  
So I spent a few hours and made a page like this. Apparently I was inspired by many excellent demo pages and tutorials. But it is a good practice, at least for me.
